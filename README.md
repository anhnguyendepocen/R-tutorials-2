=========

Short R and JAGS tutorials for beginners, mainly for use in various classes I have taught.

The tutorials are presented in a suggested order. The data directory contains data files (CSV) used in the examples. The model directory contains JAGS models used in example Bayesian analyses. The R files
include step-by-step comments and observations.

Summary of tutorial contents:

1.  Basic operations in R including math, simple functions, data formats and containers

2.  Importing data into R from spreadsheets; manipulating data in R data frames; saving R objects
    and workspaces
  
3.  Basic statistical tests in R, e.g. t-tests, ANOVA, simple linear regression

4.  Creating and customizing plots and figures in R

5.  Conditionals and true/false statements; looping structures in R (for, while loops); 
    writing custom functions
    
6.  Fitting generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models in R using
    glm(), lme(), and glmmPQL()

7.  A brief introduction to maximum likelihood estimation in R using optim()

8.  Introduction to JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) and the R interface package R2jags
    for doing Bayesian analysis in R
    
9.  Generalized linear models (logistic and Poisson) fit in JAGS

10. Mixed models in JAGS (i.e., including both fixed and random effects)
